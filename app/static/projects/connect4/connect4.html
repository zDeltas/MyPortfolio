The connect 4 game is played using a vertical grid of seven columns by six rows. Each player has 21 tokens of one color (most often red and yellow) and places them in the grid in turn.

The player can play against another player but also against an artificial intelligence, the ia uses the algorithm "pruning alpha-beta" which is based on Minimax. Allowing to optimize the search for the best move by limiting the number of nodes explored in the game tree.

3 levels of difficulty are proposed to the player, 1 and 2 will be a sequence of conditions traversed, the 3 will be the alpha-beta algorithm.

This project allowed me to discover the Minimax algorithm. While deepening my skills in C#.
