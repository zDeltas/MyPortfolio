<p>The connect 4 game is played using a vertical grid of seven columns by six rows. Each player has 21 tokens of one color (most often red and yellow) and places them in the grid in turn.</p><p>The player can play against another player but also against an artificial intelligence, the ia uses the algorithm "pruning alpha-beta" which is based on Minimax. Allowing to optimize the search for the best move by limiting the number of nodes explored in the game tree.</p><p>3 difficolty level are proposed to the player:<ol><li>Simple conditions,</li><li>Simple conditions but a little better than 1,</li><li>Use the alpha-beta algorithm.</li></ol></p><p>This project allowed me to discover the Minimax algorithm. While deepening my skills in C#.</p>
