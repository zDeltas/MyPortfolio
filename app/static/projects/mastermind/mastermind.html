<p>The objective of this exercise is to realize the Mastermind game. It is a game where you have to guess by successive deduction the color and the position of the 4 pieces hidden behind a screen. The Mastermind will take the form of a game console game in C++ language.</p><p>process of the game:</p><ol><li>The computer generates a random combination of numbers, which for the graph will be colored boxes,</li><li>By an entry on the keyboard, the user will have to find the color series,</li><li>Once the color set is validated, the computer will indicate if any pieces are well placed and/or if any pieces are misplaced.</li></ol><p>This project allowed me to acquire new skills but also new ways to program in c++, with modern programming.</p>
