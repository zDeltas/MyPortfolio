<p>For my 2nd year internship, my mission during the internship was to make available a web interface to display statistics in graphic form. As I continue my studies in the field of development.</p><p>Scientists need statistics on their use of the computing center. When a researcher needs to perform a calculation, he will submit a job to the job manager (or batch system, here GridEngine).</p><p>The project is separated in 2 parts:</p><ul><li>the back office ensures the creation of the database, maintenance. It is also here that we browse the accounting file to insert the data in the database.</li><li>The front office will be the web part. Here the users will be able to consult their calculation statistics. For the search, a choice of filters will be made available to them.</li></ul><p>This internship allowed me to discover the programming with the Flask module in python.</p>
